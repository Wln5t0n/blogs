# 1337-CTF 
The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher built on concepts from Linear Algebra. The Hill cipher makes use of modulo arithmetic, matrix multiplication, and matrix inverses; hence, it is a more mathematical cipher than others. The Hill cipher is also a block cipher, so, theoretically, it can work on arbitrary sized blocks.

Polygraphic substitution is a uniform substitution where a block of letters is substituted by a word, character, number, etc.

**Made by:- `Lester S. Hill` In 1929**

## Encryption

Encrypting with the Hill cipher is built on the following operation:  

**E(K, P) = (K*P) mod 26**

```ruby
import time
import hillCypher as hc

wait = .5

#MAIN PROGRAM

#Lets the user decides if he wants to use his own key to encode or if he wants to or have a key randomly
#assigned for him
choiceKey = input("Have you already chosen a key(a) or do you want a random key?(b):\n")

while choiceKey != "a" and choiceKey != "b":
	choiceKey = input('Please type "a" or "b" as your answer:\n')

time.sleep(wait)

if choiceKey == "b":
	K = hc.randomKey()
else:
	K = hc.chooseKey()

time.sleep(wait)

#Transform the user's message into a matrix with numbers associated to each characters 
message = input("What message do you want to encode? Write it below:\n")
messageNumber = hc.messageNumbers(message)
M = hc.matrix(messageNumber)

#encodes the message M with the key K (matrix multiplication)
encodedNumber = M.dot(K)

time.sleep(wait)

#gives back a message with characters and not numbers
hc.messageEncoded(encodedNumber, hc.alphabet)

time.sleep(wait)

input("\nPress enter to exit the encoder.\nDon't forget you'll need the key to decode the message")
```

Flag i want to encode:- `crypto-is-my-cup-of-tea-dont-you-think`
key i used:- `367659934` 
```ruby
^^/D/c/Hill-Or-Hell >>> python3 encoder.py                                                                                                                    10:45:32 
Have you already chosen a key(a) or do you want a random key?(b):
367659934
Please type "a" or "b" as your answer:
a
What key do you want to use? Please present a key with 9 numbers, without spaces:
367659934
What message do you want to encode? Write it below:
crypto-is-my-cup-of-tea-dont-you-think

Your encoded message is:
324 169 263 285 227 332 303 280 361 381 318 421 285 256 315 357 287 440 372 242 390 291 117 152 210 127 199 459 341 508 441 277 402 171 173 228 333 206 285

Don't forget you'll need the key to decode the message
```

## Decode script
```ruby
import hillCypher as hc

#MAIN PROGRAM
	
code = hc.code()
C = hc.matrix(code)

K = hc.chooseKey()
invK = hc.np.linalg.inv(K)

messageNumber = C.dot(invK)

message = hc.messageText(messageNumber, hc.alphabet)
message = "".join(message)

print("\nThe message is:")
print(message)

input("\nPress enter to exit the decoder")
```



## Output:- 
```ruby
^^/D/c/Hill-Or-Hell >>> python3 decoder.py                                                                                                                (2) 10:51:08 
What's the code to be decoded? Write it down below:
324 169 263 285 227 332 303 280 361 381 318 421 285 256 315 357 287 440 372 242 390 291 117 152 210 127 199 459 341 508 441 277 402 171 173 228 333 206 285
What key do you want to use? Please present a key with 9 numbers, without spaces:
367659934

The message is:

# Decode script breakdown

- First we imports the hillCypher module `import hillCypher as hc`
- `code()` makes random consisting of uppercase letters and spaces, and returns it as a string
- `matrix()` takes message from `code()` convert it to matrix. each message is representation by number accourding to the position eg. (a=0,b=1, and so on...) and the space is represented by the number 26. The matrix is a numpy array.
- `chooseKey()` makes random 2x2 matrix as the encryption key. This key is used to encrypt the message in the Hill cipher.
- `inv()` inverse the encryption key. This will help to decrypt the encrypted message.
- Then encrypted message is decrypted by multiplying the ciphertext matrix with the inverse of the encryption key. This is done with the `dot()` method of numpy arrays.
- `messageText()` function takes the resulting matrix of decrypted numbers and converts it back into a string of uppercase letters and spaces.
